    "Suppose the Lady Tasting Tea experiment is altered to involve twelve cups of tea. Six have the milk in first and the other six having tea in first. A person claims that they have the special power of being able to tell if the tea or the milk went into a cup first upon tasting it. You agree to accept their claim if they can tell which of the six cups in your experiment had the milk in first.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate, using Python, the probability that they select the correct six cups. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumption** - they have no special powers in figuring it out, they are guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose, now, you are willing to accept one error. Once they select the six cups they think had the milk in first, you will give them the benefit of the doubt should they have selected at least five of the correct cups. \n",
