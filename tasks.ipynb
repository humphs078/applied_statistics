    "The [*Lady Tasting Tea Experiment*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_tasting_tea) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_tasting_tea)  is an experiment devised by [Sir Ronald Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) to test the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Purported to be loosely based on an event in Fisher's life, the experiment is based on a claim by a lady friend of Fisher's that when presented with a cup of tea she could that she could discern whether milk or tea was poured first into her cup. In the experiment the lady is presented with 8 cups of tea, four of which have the milk poured first and four of which have the tea poured first. Fisher's lady friend is then asked to select which cups have the milk poured first. The probability of the lady being able to select the four cups, with milk poured first, correctly is low enough that this outcome would be unlikely. Therefore, if over mulktiple runs of the experiment if the lady correctly selects the cups with milk poured in first, a statistical unlikelihood, the lady had the ability to discern the order in which tea and milk were poured in the cup.\n",

A person claims that they have the special power of being able to tell if the tea or the milk went into a cup first upon tasting it. You agree to accept their claim if they can tell which of the six cups in your experiment had the milk in first.\n",
